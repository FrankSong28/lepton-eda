Released january 13, 2003.

As version 0.1 has appeared to be totally not functional, this is a first
version that can be really used. It has only basic functions to manage
projects, files and run tools. Commonly used actions are accessible from
the menu. 

Do not expect that all gEDA Suite tools will work good together. 
Major problems:

* PCB - is very difficult to integrate. In RedHat distribution m4 is not 
  located in /usr/local/bin what is default location used by PCB. 
  Gnetlisted schematics are not loaded by PCB. 
  
* gwave - can display only transient results.

* verilog - problems with simulation "multifile" modules.

etc.
