Bugs (no particular order): 
----------------------

	- If a component cannot be read, then this situation is not dealt 
	  with.  Technically at this point, gnetlist can't do anything so 
	  it really should exit.  Add code to do this later...

	- infinite net connection loops

	- memory leaks (lots right now)
	
        - attach an label to a net which is going to no pin and it won't
          show up. (this is because mid point connections are not being
	  dealt with properly...)

	- Ordering of pin outputs in spice netlist ouput for components like 
	  BJT transistors B C E.  This is wrong for now.



Finished stuff:
