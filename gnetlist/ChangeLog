    Fix verilog and VHDL netlist backends
    
    These were inadvertently broken when making core gnetlist changes to
    accomodate slotting in spice-sdb. Since the netlist backend is loaded
    before gnetlist has traversed the schematic, the backends must not
    execute any code which queries gnetlist on load. All such work is
    to be done only when gnetlist invokes the (<backend>) method.

    Revert "gnetlist: Strip trailing lower case suffixes from PCB package names"
    
    Stripping lower case refdes suffixes when netlisting for PCB (which
    ignores lowercase refdes suffixes) caused breakage when relying on
    matching a pinlabel=xxx to refdes=xxx inside a hierarchical
    schematic, where "xxx" had a lowercase suffix.
    
    This reverts commit e8b3be0fbcbf7518b05b437e13eeaa11478345aa.

    gnetlist: Strip trailing lower case suffixes from PCB package names
    
    Adds a custom (get-uref ...) function to the PCB, pcbpins and gsch2pcb
    back-ends. These strip lowercase suffixes from the uref, to ensure that
    slotted package names like IC1a and IC1b are treated as the same, IC1
    by gsch2pcb.
    
    This suffix stripping matches the fact that PCB ignores the lower-case
    suffix on net names. It would have been possible to leave the suffixes
    in the PCB and pcbpins output, although in the PCB netlist case, this
    causes any implicit power nets in each slot to be duplicated in the
    netlist, which PCB reports as an error.

    Fix spice-sdb slotting to work without modified pinseq attributes
    
    Removes all previous code which iterated over slots for a given package,
    replacing it with a custom (get-uref ...) procedure which ensures each
    slot of a component is given a unique uref when gnetlist traverses the
    schematic. This means each slot will appear as a separate "package" in
    the gnetlist data-structures, even if each slot uses the same refdes=
    attribute.
    
    The format for the package uref is "(refdes/uref).(slot)", in keeping
    with the existing spice-sdb slotting code.

    More efficient searching of attributes in (gnetlist:get-uref ...)
    
    Only evaluates get-attrib-value-by-attrib-name once per call, and has the
    added advantage of only defining helper functions in local namespace.

    gnetlist: Add scheme procedure get-uref to determine uref of an OBJECT
    
    Moves the logic to determine an uref based on the component attributes
    into the Scheme procedure (get-uref ...), which is passed an OBJECT smob
    for interrogation.

    Fix two use after free bugs.
    
    The gnetlist testsuite would sometimes screw up the terminal by
    outputting angry control characters.  This was because a warning
    message used a string that had already been freed.

    gnetlist: Load gnetlist.scm and backend before schematic traversal.
    
    Allows gnetlist.scm and backends to define scheme procedures and
    variables which may be used to control the schematic traversal process.
    
    Since some portions of of gnetlist.scm are evaluated immediately upon
    load, yet require execution _after_  schematic traversal, these portions
    have been split out from gnetlist.scm into a new file, gnetlist-post.scm
    which is loaded after traversal.
    
    The moved definitions are those of "packages", "all-unique-nets",
    "all-nets", "all-pins", and the refdes aliasing functionality.

    Remove the ATTRIB linked list in favour of a GList
    
    The ATTRIB.copied_to pointer is moved from the ATTRIB struct to reside in
    the source OBJECT being copied.
    
    The ATTRIB *attached_to pointer of an attribute's text OBJECT is changed
    to OBJECT *attached_to, pointing directly at the OBJECT to which that
    attribute is attached. This avoids the need to traverse the ATTRIB list
    and retrieve this pointer from the HEAD attribute node. (A HEAD node is
    not used in the GList of ATTRIBs).
    
    The ATTRIB structure now only contains one element, OBJECT *object. This
    points to the text OBJECT holding and displaying that attribute's
    "name=value".

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    Fix for Bug#1776547: graphical versus source
    
    The usage described in Bug#1776547 is pretty unique, but it might be handy
    to support in general.  The recursive source= and graphical= behavior is
    a unexpected side effect of the traversal of graphical symbols/components
    (552e06e921e4b6eb758b9483d1913c39b3fef5f5).  The fix is to explicitly
    check for the graphical= attribute and if it is found to not further
    traverse the hierarchy.  Regression tests were added so this behavior
    doesn't change in the future.

    Fixed two calls to free() where g_free() should have been used.
    
    Updated Doxygen comments to note where memory should be freed with g_free()
    rather than free(). Commented three instances where free() is correct.

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    guile-1.8.1 fixes and testsuite additions.
    
    Updated the cascade and pcbpins backends to work with guile-1.8.1.
    While here added a testsuite entry for these two backends.

    Portability fixes for the testsuite.
    
    Get the testsuite fully working on SunOS-5.9/sparc.  This
    entails two issues.  The "-I" option to diff is a GNU
    extension and is not supported by the solaris diff.  Work
    around this by using sed to filter out the lines which were
    to be ignored.  This addresses the tests run by gnetlist/tests/runtest.sh.
    
    The other issue is that the longopts tests in the spice-sdb
    testsuite should not be run on a system that does not have
    getopt_long().  To address this, extend the run_tests.sh to allow
    a variable in the tests.list file to disable a test unless set to "yes".

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated the list of reference files that go into EXTRA_DIST so that
    'make distcheck' can work again.  Now the this is fixed, re-enable
    the spice-sdb teststuite.

    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.
