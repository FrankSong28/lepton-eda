    Bumped versions to 1.2.0/20070902/31:0:0 for the next stable release

    Fix for Bug#1776547: graphical versus source
    
    The usage described in Bug#1776547 is pretty unique, but it might be handy
    to support in general.  The recursive source= and graphical= behavior is
    a unexpected side effect of the traversal of graphical symbols/components
    (552e06e921e4b6eb758b9483d1913c39b3fef5f5).  The fix is to explicitly
    check for the graphical= attribute and if it is found to not further
    traverse the hierarchy.  Regression tests were added so this behavior
    doesn't change in the future.

    Moved 3 rc promotion keywords from gschem into libgeda (fix for bug#1748143)
    
    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Alter guile 1.6 compat tests to work with older autoconf versions
    
    Don't use AC_DEFINE to define function like macros, instead use
    AC_CHECK_DECLS to set a HAVE_DECL_..., then use AH_VERBATIM to
    insert a test which defines a replacement if necessary.

    Changed configure.ac(.in) to allow guile-1.6
    
    Introduces compatibility #defines where guile 1.8 funcs are missing in
    guile 1.6. Also adds missing configure.ac checks for guile in packages
    gattrib, gnetlist, gsymcheck and utils.

    Fixed two calls to free() where g_free() should have been used.
    
    Updated Doxygen comments to note where memory should be freed with g_free()
    rather than free(). Commented three instances where free() is correct.

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    guile-1.8.1 fixes and testsuite additions.
    
    Updated the cascade and pcbpins backends to work with guile-1.8.1.
    While here added a testsuite entry for these two backends.

    Portability fixes for the testsuite.
    
    Get the testsuite fully working on SunOS-5.9/sparc.  This
    entails two issues.  The "-I" option to diff is a GNU
    extension and is not supported by the solaris diff.  Work
    around this by using sed to filter out the lines which were
    to be ignored.  This addresses the tests run by gnetlist/tests/runtest.sh.
    
    The other issue is that the longopts tests in the spice-sdb
    testsuite should not be run on a system that does not have
    getopt_long().  To address this, extend the run_tests.sh to allow
    a variable in the tests.list file to disable a test unless set to "yes".

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Add missing reference files to distribution and re-enable checks.
    Updated the list of reference files that go into EXTRA_DIST so that
    'make distcheck' can work again.  Now the this is fixed, re-enable
    the spice-sdb teststuite.

    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.
