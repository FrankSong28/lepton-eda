ChangeLog for gnetlist

Most recent changes (version wise) are at the top of this file 

5/14/99 Updated manual page a bit 

5/13/99 Integrated Mike Jarabek's verilog netlister 

4/11/99	Added some more debugging information when reading in the scm file

4/9/99	Fixed Makefile.am so that gnetlist.1 is installed

3/26/99 Added some newlines in a few places in gnetlist.scm

3/20/99 Got spice backend guile functions to follow the new 
	backend:function_name naming convention

3/19/99	Updated g_rc to print more diag message to the log file when
	it can't find an rc file (like gschem)

3/18/99 Updated g_rc to use new macros for finding system-*rc files

3/11/99 Added back the original implementation of the write-net-name-... 
	guile code for the spice netlist.  It works right for transistors.
	Mine did not.  Bummer.  Spice netlist doesn't support slotting for
	now.

3/10/99	Fixed a coredump when you pass in an "unknown" for the pin number
	in get-nets.  Return a list which is ("ERROR"). (pointed out by
	Bas Gieltjes)

	Changed ales-netlist format to geda-netlist format.  Changed
	gnetlist.scm appropriately	

	Renamed all C guile functions to be called gnetlist:<whatever>
	This makes it clear where functions come from 

	Added code to set netlist_mode which enables/disables certain
	netlist features.  Each backend should call this with something
	even if it's the default mode: gEDA

	Added gnetlist:set-netlist-mode to g_register and g_netlist which 
	sets the above mode

	Integrated tango netlist backend by Nuno Sucena (thanks)

	Changed the highest level function in all backends to take a 
	parameter which is the netlist output filename.  This is a required
	parameter

	Added -o flag which specifies output filename (for above), if you
	don't specify an output filename the default is output.net

	Integrated spice backend by Bas Gieltjes

	Had to add a kludge to gnetlist.c which sets netlist_mode based
	on the guile_proc string (for spice mode which needs to be set
	before the .sch files are read in)

	Changed the default unnamed_counter to be one instead of zero

	Fixed the incorrect behavior when you have slotted components and
	the spice backend.  

	Played a bit with the way power connections show up in the netlists
	(s_net.c and the POWER string code)  Not completely happy with 
	any of this.

3/9/99	Fixed a few variables which were uninitialized (width, height,
	snap_size)

1/24/99 Removed some // comments (shouldn't use those in C code)

12/3/98 Added thi's small gnetlist patch

11/8/98	Changed the ales-netlist slightly (less newlines)

	Started adding code to resolve same net names

	Found a really nasty bug, wasn't initalizing net_name in cpinlist!

	Found several really nasty bugs, where something was initalized
	incorrectly (strings = 0 ?!?) (s_net.c in add function)

	Found another missing init (object_ptr) in s_netlist.c (add function)

	Found another missing init (original) in s_cpinlist.c (add function)

	All of the above bugs were apparently the cause of the mysterious
	guile 1.3 problem.  Further testing is needed

10/25/98 Cleaned up all warnings 

10/24/98 Discovered that gnetlist doesn't like guile 1.3

	 Fixed a memory overrite in s_net_name, also added a return(NULL)

	 Fixed a place where I was freeing a null pointer in g_get_packages

	 Found/fixed another "trying to free null data"

 	 Updated gnetlist.scm with display-connections (output.net looks 
	 better)

10/20/98 Fixed a bug which prevented gnetlist to work with guile 1.3

	 Change rc file guile primative version to gnetlist-version

10/18/98 Changed o_attrib_search_name_single to pass a null in for the last
	 argument

10/12/98 Added guile code to handle unconnected pins (gnetlist.scm)

	 Found a place where U? wasn't being set.

10/11/98 Added parsecmd.c (commandline argument parsing)

         Simplified the loading of schematic sheets and intergrated above

	 Added the actual command line options (-v for verbose mode) and
	 (-i for guile interactive mode)  Default for both of these is
	 off

	 Added usage() function (which exits when called)

	 Added quiet_mode to the command line arguments, to shut off all
	 messages

	 Removed all warnings

	 Worked on gnetlist.scm to get some guile code to drive some of 
	 the new netlist code
	
	 Added and registered g_get_package_attribute guile function which
	 returns the wanted attribute from the specified package uref

	 Added command line option -g guile_proc so you can execute guile
	 scripts from the command line 

	 Added code to support above

	 More work into gnetlist.scm to get some sort of netlist writer 
	 going
		

10/10/98 Added file s_traverse.c which creates flat netlist datastructure

	 Serious work on getting netlist code to work!

	 Add s_net.c (functions that deal with the net structure) 

	 Add s_netlist.c (functions that deal with the netlist struct)

	 Add s_cpinlist.c (functions that deal with the cpinlist struct)

	 Completely preliminary code for netlist generation (first cut,
	 highly inefficient, but works! :)

	 Updated g_get_packages to use the new available structures (much
	 faster)

	 Updated g_get_pins to use the new available structures (much
	 faster)

	 Added (exit) and (quit) guile functions

	 Found a condition where my attempt to speed up the netlist post
	 processing, but it found a nasty bug, so now we have a 3 pass
	 post process. 
	

0.0.5
-------

9/19/98 Improved the input gathering code for the guile shell a bit.

9/13/98 Changed netlist.scm to gnetlist.scm

	Fixed g_rc_scheme_directory to store the string in the structure 

9/4/98	Made then necessary changes to have gnetlist use libgeda

	Fixed a few minor tidbits related to above
	
8/30/98 Added embedded component support from gschem to gnetlist
 
8/29/98 Added complex_parent pointer to object structure

	Added code to fill above pointer 

	Added s_netlist.c and added it to Makefile.am

	Added first cut of GUILE netlist routines	
		g_get_packages

	Added s_scratch.c (misc scratch buffer routines)

	Made some changes to the attribute handling, head attrib node 
	points to the object where the attributes belong to.  Be sure 	
	to propegate this change back to gschem (done)

	Made sure that text_string is only set when it should be by 
	setting p_text_string[0] = '\0'.  Be sure to propegate this change
	back to gschem (done)

	Added a bunch of attribute search routines to support all this
	Be sure to propagate these attribute routines back go gschem

	Wrote some test scheme code which is in ../bin/netlist.scm

8/25/98	Added code into the repository and devel tree

	Fixed logging mechanism

	Added appropriate lines in all the upper makefiles to build this code

	Code doesn't do anything other then read in the schematics
