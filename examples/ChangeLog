    Make sure various files are installed.
    
    Several new files were not being distributed. This patch addresses the
    problem by adding files to EXTRA_DIST in automake input files.

    Had to tweak gschem/po/de_DE.po since it was changed on the stable-1.0
    branch after this commit.  Removed libgeda/lib/Makefile.am and
    libgeda/scheme/Makefile.am which are not exist on this branch.  Had to
    manually add ChangeLog-1.0 to symbols/Makefile.am (this last fix should
    also probably go onto master).

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.
