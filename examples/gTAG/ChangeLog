	* Added the lines 
	  (hierarchy-netname-mangle "disabled")
          (hierarchy-uref-mangle "disabled")
	  to gnetlistrc so PCB likes the PCB netlist gnetlist generates.

	* Added C20 after suggestion from Andrew Dyer.
	* Changed distribution script so the generated PCB netlist is
	  called gTAG-pcb.net due to possible name clash with PCB layout.
	* Added R20-R23 after suggestion from Andrew Dyer.
