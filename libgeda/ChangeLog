    Validate calls to scm_c_eval_string(). [2105219]
    
    Because the reporter's version of Guile is broken, a lovely garbage
    collector segfault occurs if a null string is passed to
    scm_c_eval_string().
    
    For now, replace most calls to scm_c_eval_string() with user-provided
    arguments by g_scm_c_eval_string_protected(), and modify the latter to
    behave well with a NULL argument. This has the added advantage of
    providing backtraces in more places.

    libgeda: fixed EOL handling for mixed windows/linux usage
    
    A file that is created on windows with windows EOL characters

    update the pinnumbers if a slot attribute is deleted
    
    Update the slots whenever a text line that is attached to an object
    gets deleted. The update checks the slotting even if there's no slot
    attribut. This catches the case when the user deletes a slot attribute
    and the current displayed pinnumbers are not the ones defined in the
    symbol. This commit fixes [#1880221]

    Fix invalid memory access with auto-save filename being used after free.
    
    Use the "full_filename" variable in f_open_flags() as a base for the
    auto-save filename. Previous code uses the passed in "filename" argument,
    however in some cases this argument points to memory which is free'd in
    f_open_flags() after determining "full_filename".

    Added checks at the autogen.sh stage for missing m4 macros
    
    This commit adds a autoconf friendly m4 macro to check for undefined
    macros (originally written by Peter Brett).  This macro is used in
    configure.ac.in to check for a few troublesome macros (guile, nls,
    gettext, intltool) that are usually missing because a required -dev
    package is not installed/missing.

Date:   Tue Jan 1 14:29:27 2008 -0500

    Changed libgeda's configure mechanism to be similar to gschem's configure.ac.in
    
    In order to allow a wide range of gettext versions to be used, gschem has
    a configure hack that dynamically figures out the gettext version and creates
    configure.ac from configure.ac.in.  This hack is now in libgeda with the
    additional improvement that if configure.ac.in changes, configure.ac and
    configure are automatically recreated.  Added a special mode to autogen.sh
    (recreate_configure_only) to support this improvement.

    Fix problem where changing slot= would not update pins
    
    Known to break spice-sdb's slotted component handling, however users
    are much more likely to encounter the former breakage.  Original patch
    removed the offending code, but this patch just #if's it out for now.

    Change image embedding format to base64 encode the original files
    
    Previously, the format was a base64 encoding of serialised output from
    the gdk_pixbuf used to store the image internally. Due to another bug
    (now fixed) it is known that no official gEDA release could re-load
    the embedded images that it saved. This hopefully provides some
    justification as to why its OK to change the embedding format here.

    Compute picture aspect ratio in double arithmetic, not integer.
    
    Avoids a nasty bug where coordinates would overflow when attempting to
    grip-adjust the picture size due to this ratio being incorrect.

    Add desktop mime integration and icons to libgeda
    
    The schematic and symbol mimetype icons and registration data were
    contrinuted by Tomaz Solc, and subsequently modified by Peter Clifton,
    including creation of a gsch2pcb icon in a simlar style. The page outline
    is from the GNOME icon theme's text-x-generic icon by Jakub Steiner.
    
    Uses the intltool framework to translate the mime registration file.

    libgeda headers and their dependency headers in the correct order.
    Change libgeda C files to include just this header rather than all the
    individual headers explicitly.  This will make it easier to split out
    the libgeda headers into public and private declarations.

    libgeda: Clean g_assert() usage.
    
    g_assert() is a heavy-handed approach to sanity checking because it
    kills the user application on failure.  It's better to use

    libgeda: define s_log_message -> g_message
    
    s_log_message was a verbatim copy of the definition of the g_message

    to include that header anyway -- this patch removes the unnecessary
    duplication of code.

    clib: Speed up caching by using pointer rather than string keys.
    
    The initial version of the symbol cache used the symbol name as a
    string as the key, mostly because of the obnoxious 'const' keywords I
    had put in the definition of s_clib_symbol_get_data().  Having found a
    way around that, using a pointer to the symbol structure as the key is
    much faster as it avoids costly string comparisons and allocation of
    heap memory (as well as being slightly more elegant).

    Fix bug introduced with refactoring of object mirroring API to libgeda.
    
    When reading a complex object from file, the mirror property of the
    complex is set to the desired value and later code then mirrors the
    prim_objs which make up the complex. o_complex_mirror_world() was used
    by mistake, where o_list_mirror_world() should have been used.
    
    This could be refactored so that complex creation uses higher level
    o_complex_{rotate,mirror}_world(), rather than setting the variables
    holding rotation / mirroring state, then manipulating the prim_objs.

    Without explicitly initialising OBJECTs to have a copied_to pointer of
    NULL, copying a selection containing an attribute but not it's parent
    object could cause a segfault. The code checks to see where the parent
    object has been copied for correct attachemnt of the new attrib. If
    the parent object wasn't copied, this pointer should be NULL.

    Improve object mirroring API in libgeda + gschem
    
    Implements the o_mirror_world() function which rotates any object, and
    o_{glist,list}_mirror_world() functions which mirror lists of objects.
    
    Moves o_complex_mirror_world() from gschem into libgeda, and modifies
    appropriate places in libgeda + gschem to use the new API. The old
    gschem function o_mirror_world() becomes o_mirror_world_update(), a
    convenience function calling o_glist_mirror_world() and ensuring all
    necessary drawing and connection updates are made.
    
    Removes the o_complex_mirror_lowlevel() function which is made redundant
    by the above changes.

    Moves o_complex_rotate_world() from gschem into libgeda, and modifies
    appropriate places in libgeda + gschem to use this new API. The gschem
    function o_rotate_90_world() is greatly simplified, becoming a
    convenience function calling o_glist_rotate_world() and ensuring all
    necessary drawing and connection updates are made. This function is
    renamed o_rotate_world_update().
    
    Removes the o_{complex,text}_rotate_lowlevel() functions which are made
    redundant with the above changes.

    Alter system-gafrc to process .scm files in $GEDA_DATA_DIR/gafrc.d/
    
    This change allows each symbol package (e.g. geda-symbols) to install a
    scheme config file under this dir to load its contents. This allows
    additional symbol packages to be installed globally without needing to edit
    either geda-clib.scm or system-gafrc.
    
    Also moves the installation of geda-clib.scm into this directory.

    Remove the ATTRIB linked list in favour of a GList
    
    The ATTRIB.copied_to pointer is moved from the ATTRIB struct to reside in
    the source OBJECT being copied.
    
    The ATTRIB *attached_to pointer of an attribute's text OBJECT is changed
    to OBJECT *attached_to, pointing directly at the OBJECT to which that
    attribute is attached. This avoids the need to traverse the ATTRIB list
    and retrieve this pointer from the HEAD attribute node. (A HEAD node is
    not used in the GList of ATTRIBs).
    
    The ATTRIB structure now only contains one element, OBJECT *object. This
    points to the text OBJECT holding and displaying that attribute's
    "name=value".

    Split out gschem specific TOPLEVEL variables into a new GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL
    
    GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL has a TOPLEVEL *toplevel pointer as its first elelment,
    gschem uses this to call libgeda functions. (Almost) all gschem functions
    now take the GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL as their first argument.

    Move libgeda's o_selection_unselect_list() into gschem.
    
    The function calls o_redraw_single(), so should be in gschem.
    It is now named o_select_unselect_list().

    Fix a bug in o_attrib_search_name_single() were it might return NULL.
    
    If o_attrib_search_name_single() doesn't find an attribute attached to
    the passed OBJECT, it checks if the passed OBJECT is itsself an attribute.
    In this case, it would return NULL (the result from the preceeding search).
    
    The bug might not actually be triggered in normal usage, as most callers
    don't pass a variable to recieve the OBJECT pointer.

    Remove the redundant toplevel variables current_{show,visible}.
    
    These variables were previously used for an interactive method of attrib
    placement which has since been removed. The current_visible variable was
    also tested during non-attribute text placement, but to no effect.
    
    Whilst the file-format does technically allow invisible text, gschem's UI
    pesesnts no way to achieve it, so removing this variable does no harm. The
    ability to correctly load schematics with invisible text remains.

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    This is a fix for (Patch#) 1789290 libgeda-1.2.0 fprintf which supplied a

    libgeda/src/s_textbuffer.c.  In the future, all releases will be built with
    gtk+ 2.4.x so that these sorts of problems do not get released.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    Avoids testing a GtkWidget pointer in TOPLEVEL variable setup by gschem or

    Fix memory corruption and possible segfault copying attributes
    
    If an object (but not all its attributes) was selected and copied, dangling
    pointers were left in the un-copied attributes. A subsequent copy operation
    containing those missed attributes would attempt to reattach them to the
    copy of their parent. If this had been deleted in the mean time, memory
    corruption and a possible segfault would occur.
    
    Consolidates the duplicated code which sets the ATTRIB property "copied_to"
    into a helper function, o_attrib_list_copied_to(). This is also used to
    clean up after copy operations.

    Avoid using s_hierarchy_up() for traversal when we know where we're going.
    
    When trying to reach a specific parent we've come from before, we can use
    s_page_goto() and avoid the search through the page list.

    Added undo-panzoom keyword to control if pan/zoom cmds are undoable
    
    The default is to still store the pan/zoom info when panning or zooming,
    but now the user has a choice.

    Moved 3 rc promotion keywords from gschem into libgeda (fix for bug#1748143)
    
    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Alter guile 1.6 compat tests to work with older autoconf versions
    
    Don't use AC_DEFINE to define function like macros, instead use
    AC_CHECK_DECLS to set a HAVE_DECL_..., then use AH_VERBATIM to
    insert a test which defines a replacement if necessary.

    guile 1.6. Also adds missing configure.ac checks for guile in packages
    gattrib, gnetlist, gsymcheck and utils.

    Fix unselect code to only update colors etc. when the object was selected.
    
    Fixes a regression introduced with the GedaList based selection code. When
    asked to remove an object from the selection, we must check its actually
    selected before calling o_selection_unselect() to re-color the object.

    Fixed two calls to free() where g_free() should have been used.
    
    Updated Doxygen comments to note where memory should be freed with g_free()
    rather than free(). Commented three instances where free() is correct.

    Free strings from scm_to_locale_string() with free(), not g_free()
    
    NB: All other code in geda uses g_strdup (SCM_STRING_CHARS (...)) to
    convert strings from guile, so is not affected.

    Change selection code to use a generic GedaList typecast to SELECTION.
    
    GedaList allows various parts of the program to keep track of changes
    to the selection via callbacks attached to the GedaList object.

Author: Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>
Date:   Thu Jul 19 15:06:57 2007 +0100

    Added new GedaList class derived from GObject
    
    This abstracts a GList with API for write access. Its main use is in list
    change notification, as it emits a "changed" g_signal when modified.
    Read only access to the underlying GList is provided by an accessor,
    currenly implemented as a macro.

    Added string != NULL check in u_basic_breakup_string.
    
    The lack of this check can be the cause of a segfault (bug #1748153).
    Programs shouldn't pass NULL strings to this function.

    If a component library is added which has the same name as an existing library,
    rewrites the name in the form "name<number>".

    Oops, incorrectly specified libgeda's shared library version.
    
    The format for this version is X:Y:Z and for the most part the major
    number just increments every release if there aren't any changes to
    any interfaces.  For detailed information on how to change this number

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Implemented the ability to change the color of junctions (code for #1746675).
    
    The filled circles (at the junction of nets) and filled boxes (at the
    end of unconnected nets) were the same color and it was hard to tell the
    difference from a distance.  This patch addes (junction-color ...) rc
    keyword and allows the user to change the junction color.  The default
    color for the dark color scheme is yellow and the default color for the
    light color scheme is purple.

    libgeda: s_clib_toplevel_get_symbol_names() is poorly named.
    
    s_clib_toplevel_get_symbol_names() returns symbols, not names of
    symbols, so rename it to s_clib_toplevel_get_symbols().

    libgeda: Add fine-grained control over f_open() behaviour.
    
    Add a function f_open_flags() which takes an extra argument which is a
    set of flags controlling actions taking while opening a file. f_open()
    wraps this with a default set of flags.
    
    Coincidentally, this also leads to a trivial fix for the file open
    dialog backup-message bug.

    schematics.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated copyright text/header in most source files.
    
    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    Re-enable s_clib_refresh().
    
    Now that OBJECT and TOPLEVEL no longer store pointers to CLibSymbol
    structures, calling s_clib_refresh() is no longer likely to cause a
    segfault.

commit 67038ed9bece3a1317757b58a982ed29af2831c6

    Don't cache symbol pointers in persistent structures.
    
    Several persistent structures, including TOPLEVEL and OBJECT, cache
    pointers to CLibSymbols.  This is bad, because it makes removing
    component sources or rescanning them likely to cause stale pointers
    around the place.
    
    With fast hashtable-cached searches in place, this is no longer
    necessary.  This patch ensures that only symbol names are stored
    persistently.
    
    This patch also enables descending into embedded symbols using a
    component library lookup on the embedded symbol's name.

    Add s_clib_get_symbol_by_name().
    
    Add a new function which returns the first exact match for a given
    symbol name, printing log messages if either there are more than one
    match or no matches are found at all.  Also update
    s_clib_symbol_get_data_by_name() to use new function and remove
    o_complex_add_by_name() as more or less redundant.

    Make comp. library search faster and more flexible
    
    Replace s_clib_glob() with s_clib_search(), which can operate in
    either exact matching or glob matching mode.  Use a hashtable to cache
    the results of library searches. The hashtable is cleared every time
    it is invalidated (for instance if a component source is added or
    removed, or the component sources are rescanned).

    Refactor system RC files
    
    Moved system-gafrc into the libgeda package, where it belongs.
    Removed all environment and configure substitutions.  Created separate
    font and component library setup scripts in the symbols package,
    automatically loaded by system-gafrc if they exist.  Updated
    system-gschemrc to use new infrastructure.

    Fix gschem's sort-component-library option
    
    In the last release, the sort-component-library gschemrc option did
    nothing.  This patch corrects the issue, by adding an argument to
    s_clib_get_sources which enables or disables sorting the list of
    component sources.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.

    Fix for lack of permission-related file attributes on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733728, with some tweaks, from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    Define some file permissions as 0 if they are not defined.
    Don't use chown if it is not available.

    Match .sym suffix case-insensively when building component library.
    
    When building symbol lists for directory-based component sources,
    match the ".sym" filename suffix case-insensitively.  Note that for
    backward- compatibility (and sanity on systems with case-sensitive
    filenames) searching for symbols does match symbols
    case-sensitively ("plug.SYM" will not satisfy a search for
    "plug.sym").

    Add component sources based on Scheme procedures.
    
    Add the ability to use a set of Scheme procedures which list and
    return component symbols as the backend of a component library.  Adds
    the g_rc_component_library_funcs() and s_clib_add_scm() functions to
    libgeda, as well as the component-library-funcs rc file function.

    Change way that component source conflicts are checked.
    
    Allow the same component source to be added more than once, but only
    if it has a unique name.  Also adds s_clib_get_source_by_name().

    Sort lists of component sources and symbols.
    
    Adds functions to compare sources and symbols by name
    case-insensitively, and makes the both s_clib_source_get_symbols() and
    s_clib_get_sources() return lists sorted by name.

    (component-library) take an optional second argument for the
    directory's source name.

    Provide better names for component sources.
    
    Full pathnames aren't very user-friendly in the component
    browser, and sometimes the name you want for your
    component source isn't the same as the directory name. This
    patch provides an infrastructure for better source naming,
    while falling back to the "classic" behaviour if necessary.

    Implement new component library system in libgeda.
    
    A new component library model is needed to allow gschem etc.
    to work well with part database systems.  This patch
    provides the necessary infrastructure in libgeda, without
    the frontend Guile commands required to make use of the new
    features.  In particular, it abstracts the component
    library into the concepts of "Component Sources" and
    "Symbols", and allows external "Library Commands" to
    provide symbol data in addition to the traditional directory
    libraries.
    
    In order to allow the new system to work, there are major
    changes in all code which manipulates COMPLEX objects; in
    particular, the magic "EMBEDDED" string is now only used
    in the on-disc representation.

    Make libgeda parse schematics from buffered data.
    
    In order to support more complex methods of acquiring symbol
    data, libgeda needs to be able to load schematics and symbols
    directly from a memory buffer as well as from files.

commit 2f30fb34dbbeb61650d69737913e80daa75dc172
Author: Peter TB Brett <peter@peter-b.co.uk>
Date:   Mon May 28 07:27:23 2007 +0000

    Add managed text buffers to libgeda.
    
    In order to facilitate loading symbols & schematics from
    memory without an extensive rewrite, this patch adds an API
    for reading memory arrays a bit like a file.
    
    Using memory streams & fgets would be nicer, but unfortunately
    memory streams are a GNU libc extension.
