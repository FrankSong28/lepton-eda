    Added undo-panzoom keyword to control if pan/zoom cmds are undoable
    
    The default is to still store the pan/zoom info when panning or zooming,
    but now the user has a choice.

    Moved 3 rc promotion keywords from gschem into libgeda (fix for bug#1748143)
    
    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Avoid using s_hierarchy_up() for traversal when we know where we're going.
    
    When trying to reach a specific parent we've come from before, we can use
    s_page_goto() and avoid the search through the page list.

    Alter guile 1.6 compat tests to work with older autoconf versions
    
    Don't use AC_DEFINE to define function like macros, instead use
    AC_CHECK_DECLS to set a HAVE_DECL_..., then use AH_VERBATIM to
    insert a test which defines a replacement if necessary.

Date:   Tue Jul 31 20:03:51 2007 +0100

    Changed configure.ac(.in) to allow guile-1.6
    
    Introduces compatibility #defines where guile 1.8 funcs are missing in
    guile 1.6. Also adds missing configure.ac checks for guile in packages
    gattrib, gnetlist, gsymcheck and utils.

Author: Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>
Date:   Fri Jul 27 23:44:23 2007 +0100

    Fix unselect code to only update colors etc. when the object was selected.
    
    Fixes a regression introduced with the GedaList based selection code. When
    asked to remove an object from the selection, we must check its actually
    selected before calling o_selection_unselect() to re-color the object.

commit 31f65059cf1ce5be9b8a0987d4538fed075a6805
Author: Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>
Date:   Wed Jul 25 02:09:15 2007 +0100

    Fixed two calls to free() where g_free() should have been used.
    
    Updated Doxygen comments to note where memory should be freed with g_free()
    rather than free(). Commented three instances where free() is correct.

commit 305c10f50464f02e32d84140db69f158da6e4c47
Author: Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>
Date:   Wed Jul 25 00:52:36 2007 +0100

    Free strings from scm_to_locale_string() with free(), not g_free()
    
    NB: All other code in geda uses g_strdup (SCM_STRING_CHARS (...)) to
    convert strings from guile, so is not affected.

    Add call to g_type_init() in libgeda_init() as libgeda now uses GObject

Author: Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>
Date:   Thu Jul 19 15:09:56 2007 +0100

    Change selection code to use a generic GedaList typecast to SELECTION.
    
    GedaList allows various parts of the program to keep track of changes
    to the selection via callbacks attached to the GedaList object.

commit 10e79873064a096f8af4b0b6dcb9f957be0f6859
Author: Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>
Date:   Thu Jul 19 15:06:57 2007 +0100

    Added new GedaList class derived from GObject
    
    This abstracts a GList with API for write access. Its main use is in list
    change notification, as it emits a "changed" g_signal when modified.
    Read only access to the underlying GList is provided by an accessor,
    currenly implemented as a macro.

Author: Ales Hvezda <ahvezda@seul.org>
Date:   Sun Jul 8 16:18:57 2007 -0400

    Updated configure.ac[.in] and Makefile versions in prep for a release.
    
    The update was done by running ./update-versions.sh 1.1.1 20070708 30:1
    at the toplevel.  libgeda's shared library version is now 30:1:0

Date:   Sun Jul 8 20:57:30 2007 +0200

    Added string != NULL check in u_basic_breakup_string.
    
    The lack of this check can be the cause of a segfault (bug #1748153).
    Programs shouldn't pass NULL strings to this function.

    Added new scheme function: get-line-width .
    
    Added new scheme function, get-line-width, which returns the line
    width used to draw a given object.

    libgeda: Handle multiple libraries with the same name nicely.
    
    If a component library is added which has the same name as an existing library,
    rewrites the name in the form "name<number>".

    Oops, incorrectly specified libgeda's shared library version.
    
    The format for this version is X:Y:Z and for the most part the major
    number just increments every release if there aren't any changes to
    any interfaces.  For detailed information on how to change this number
    see:

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

Author: Ales Hvezda <ahvezda@seul.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 4 23:32:15 2007 -0400

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Implemented the ability to change the color of junctions (code for #1746675).
    
    The filled circles (at the junction of nets) and filled boxes (at the
    end of unconnected nets) were the same color and it was hard to tell the
    difference from a distance.  This patch addes (junction-color ...) rc
    keyword and allows the user to change the junction color.  The default
    color for the dark color scheme is yellow and the default color for the
    light color scheme is purple.

    libgeda: s_clib_toplevel_get_symbol_names() is poorly named.
    
    s_clib_toplevel_get_symbol_names() returns symbols, not names of
    symbols, so rename it to s_clib_toplevel_get_symbols().

    Allow different commands to be specified for 'list' and 'get' with
    custom command-line arguments.

Author: Peter TB Brett <peter@peter-b.co.uk>
Date:   Thu Jun 28 15:50:31 2007 +0100

    libgeda: Add fine-grained control over f_open() behaviour.
    
    Add a function f_open_flags() which takes an extra argument which is a
    set of flags controlling actions taking while opening a file. f_open()
    wraps this with a default set of flags.
    
    Coincidentally, this also leads to a trivial fix for the file open
    dialog backup-message bug.

    libgeda: Add function which retrieves a list of symbols in use.
    
    Add the s_toplevel_get_symbol_names() function, which scans a TOPLEVEL
    structure to obtain a list of all symbols used in open
    schematics.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated copyright text/header in most source files.
    
    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    Removed libgd and indent tests from configure scripts.
    
    indent is no longer use since noweb was removed a long time ago.
    libgd is no longer used since libgeda/gschem uses mage export support in gdk.

    Several new files were not being distributed. This patch addresses the

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Re-enable s_clib_refresh().
    
    Now that OBJECT and TOPLEVEL no longer store pointers to CLibSymbol
    structures, calling s_clib_refresh() is no longer likely to cause a
    segfault.

Date:   Sat Jun 23 13:50:57 2007 +0100

    Don't cache symbol pointers in persistent structures.
    
    Several persistent structures, including TOPLEVEL and OBJECT, cache
    pointers to CLibSymbols.  This is bad, because it makes removing
    component sources or rescanning them likely to cause stale pointers
    around the place.
    
    With fast hashtable-cached searches in place, this is no longer
    necessary.  This patch ensures that only symbol names are stored
    persistently.
    
    This patch also enables descending into embedded symbols using a
    component library lookup on the embedded symbol's name.

    Add a new function which returns the first exact match for a given
    symbol name, printing log messages if either there are more than one
    match or no matches are found at all.  Also update
    s_clib_symbol_get_data_by_name() to use new function and remove
    o_complex_add_by_name() as more or less redundant.

    Make comp. library search faster and more flexible
    
    Replace s_clib_glob() with s_clib_search(), which can operate in
    either exact matching or glob matching mode.  Use a hashtable to cache
    the results of library searches. The hashtable is cleared every time
    it is invalidated (for instance if a component source is added or
    removed, or the component sources are rescanned).

    Fix gschem's sort-component-library option
    
    In the last release, the sort-component-library gschemrc option did
    nothing.  This patch corrects the issue, by adding an argument to
    s_clib_get_sources which enables or disables sorting the list of
    component sources.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.

    Match .sym suffix case-insensively when building component library.
    
    When building symbol lists for directory-based component sources,
    match the ".sym" filename suffix case-insensitively.  Note that for
    backward- compatibility (and sanity on systems with case-sensitive
    filenames) searching for symbols does match symbols
    case-sensitively ("plug.SYM" will not satisfy a search for
    "plug.sym").

    Provide better names for component sources.
    
    Full pathnames aren't very user-friendly in the component
    browser, and sometimes the name you want for your
    component source isn't the same as the directory name. This
    patch provides an infrastructure for better source naming,
    while falling back to the "classic" behaviour if necessary.

    Implement new component library system in libgeda.
    
    A new component library model is needed to allow gschem etc.
    to work well with part database systems.  This patch
    provides the necessary infrastructure in libgeda, without
    the frontend Guile commands required to make use of the new
    features.  In particular, it abstracts the component
    library into the concepts of "Component Sources" and
    "Symbols", and allows external "Library Commands" to
    provide symbol data in addition to the traditional directory
    libraries.
    
    In order to allow the new system to work, there are major
    changes in all code which manipulates COMPLEX objects; in
    particular, the magic "EMBEDDED" string is now only used
    in the on-disc representation.

    Make libgeda parse schematics from buffered data.
    
    In order to support more complex methods of acquiring symbol
    data, libgeda needs to be able to load schematics and symbols
    directly from a memory buffer as well as from files.

    Add managed text buffers to libgeda.
    
    In order to facilitate loading symbols & schematics from
    memory without an extensive rewrite, this patch adds an API
    for reading memory arrays a bit like a file.
    
    Using memory streams & fgets would be nicer, but unfortunately
    memory streams are a GNU libc extension.
