    Make sure various files are installed.
    
    Several new files were not being distributed. This patch addresses the
    problem by adding files to EXTRA_DIST in automake input files.

    Had to tweak gschem/po/de_DE.po since it was changed on the stable-1.0
    branch after this commit.  Removed libgeda/lib/Makefile.am and
    libgeda/scheme/Makefile.am which are not exist on this branch.  Had to
    manually add ChangeLog-1.0 to symbols/Makefile.am (this last fix should
    also probably go onto master).

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Fixed the odd behavior of not cancelling the placement of components.
    
    Fixed a behavior where you would cancel (via right mouse button or escape)
    the placing of components, but gschem would still be in the add component
    mode (and clicks would still place components).

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.
    
    Changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING to 1.0- since this is the stable-1.0 branch.
    Had to resolve a cherry-pick conflict in gattrib's about dialog box since
    it changed a bit more on the master branch.

    Use "=" instead of "==" as an operator for test as the former
