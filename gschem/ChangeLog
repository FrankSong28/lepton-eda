    Fix for Bug# 1782032: Blank attibute name when attribute value starts with " "
    
    In order to fix this bug, we needed to validate the input attribute when:
    1) input an attribute using the single attribute editor,
    2) Add an attribute in the multi-attribute editor
    3) Modify the name or value of an attribute in the multi-attribute editor
    An attribute is not valid if the name or value are empty, name ends with a
    space, and/or value starts with a space.  o_attrib_get_name_value does
    this validation throughout gaf.

    Moved refresh button in component select dialog box
    
    The refresh button was along the very bottom of the component select
    dialog box at the same level as Close, Apply, and OK.  The refresh
    operation is not nearly as important or first class as these actions.
    The refresh button was moved to the filter area.  Whether this change
    sticks depends on what users think of the new location (I'm quite willing
    to move it elsewhere if there is a better spot).

    Moved 3 rc promotion keywords from gschem into libgeda (fix for bug#1748143)
    
    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Make updates faster when typing in the component selector filter.
    
    The filtering process doesn't happen until after the user pauses typing.
    Reducing the update delay from 300ms to 200ms makes this feel better.

Date:   Sun Aug 12 01:56:58 2007 +0100

    Fix crash closing component selector window quickly after filtering.
    
    Typing in the filter box adds new update timeouts (300ms) with each
    keystroke. If typing fast there could be more than one timer active at
    once, however only the last added is cancelled when closing the dialog.
    Timers which ran after the dialog closed could cause a segfault.
    
    We now cancel any pending timeout before adding a new one.

    Change color in the multi-attrib dialog "value" entry when insensitive.
    
    Makes the "value" GtkTextView look the same as its neighbouring widgets
    when insensitive. Unfortunately GtkTextView always appears to render using
    the style's GTK_STATE_NORMAL text color. We save that initial value, and
    copy across either the saved value, or the GTK_STATE_INSENSITIVE text color
    when setting the widget sensitivities.
    
    NB: This is just a workaround for what appears to be a bug in GTK+.

    Update the multi-attrib dialog after an undo operation.
    
    The undo mechanism replaces the page (and selection object), so we need to
    poke the multi-attrib dialog after an undo operation for it to watch the
    new page's selection object.

    Don't blank the add attribute boxes in the Multiattrib dialog.
    
    Leaving the text present after adding an attribute makes it is easier to
    add the same attribute to multiple objects. Instead we add a "grab-focus"
    signal handler to select the text box contents as we tab into it.

    Alter panning code to center the page in the viewport if under-zoomed
    
    Centering is independant in the X and Y directions. When the viewport is
    larger than the page canvas in a particular direction the page is
    re-centered in that direction. This is necessary for a nice preview.
    Also change preview widget code to remove the A_PAN_IGNORE_BORDERS flag
    from zoom operations, which is no-longer needed with the above changes.

    Make the preview widget resizable
    
    Added handler for the configure event to resize the backing store and
    re-zoom the preview. Added the A_PAN_IGNORE_BORDERS flag to the zoom
    extents calls - giving a nice centered preview.
    
    Altered component selector dialog's alignment widget to allow the preview
    widget to expand to fill the available space.

    Fix mouse initiated zoom / panning operations on the preview widget
    
    The preview widget isn't called with a filename for previewing component
    sources, so the test for filename != NULL in the mouse event handlers
    stopped those callbacks working.
    
    Also added a scroll event handler to allow zooming with the mouse wheel.

    Fix zoom extents to work correctly first time. Closes bug #1699959.
    
    A page's visible area is intialised to be the same size as the canvas
    extents. The zoom extents code scales based on this visible area, however
    this initialisation isn't correct, since the aspect ratio of the screen
    doesn't always match the canvas extents. The first call to zoom extents
    would fix this by correctly setting the visible area.
    
    By making the zoom extents code work from the screen aspect ratio (scaled
    to world coordinates), we can zoom to the visible extents in one shot.
    
    Also fixed some /2 operations, which for doubles should be /2.0

    Save/restore geometry of the GtkHPaned in the component selection dialog.

Author: Peter Clifton <pcjc2@cam.ac.uk>
Date:   Sat Jul 21 19:16:24 2007 +0100

    Extend GschemDialog to allow hooking to save/restore internal geometry
    
    GschemDialog now emits "geometry-save" and "geometry-restore" signals
    which instances can connect to. Subclasses may over-ride and chain the
    "geometry_save" and "geometry_restore" class members. These signal handlers
    are passed a pointer to the GKeyFile and a text string identifying the
    group it expects data to be saved under.
    
    The code relies on features only available in GLIB 2.6 onwards. When using
    this functionality the code must be surrounded with an appropriate test as
    the class functions are not defined when compiling against an older GLIB.

    Make the multi-attribute editor non-modal

    have attributes is selected. Work is required to act more intelligently if
    an attribute its-self is selected, and with multiple selections.

    Change selection code to use a generic GedaList typecast to SELECTION.
    
    GedaList allows various parts of the program to keep track of changes
    to the selection via callbacks attached to the GedaList object.

    Split out update(s) when notify::toplevel on GschemDialog is recieved.
    
    We need to perform various setup actions when the toplevel property of our
    parent GschemDialog is set. We need to make this a specific function, as
    the current method of just calling pagesel_update isn't correct for all
    future cases.

    Fixed memory leak placing components.
    
    When placing components we free'd the complex_place_list without removing
    the objects it pointed to. The code now uses s_delete_object_glist(..)
    rather than g_list_free(..) to free the complex_place list and its objects.

    Rotating while copying is still not supported, so disable it.
    Fix behaviour when hitting the rotate hotkey, or select the edit->rotate menu
    while moving.
    Previously the move action was cancelled and then the selection was rotated.
    Now, the objects being moved are rotated, and the move action continues.

    Fixed drawing bug when attribute autoplacing is enabled.
    
    When rotating while placing a new component, the refdes was drawn
    wrongly, and it was shown fixed in the screen despite the component
    being moved.
    This was due to attribute autoplacing function was called before drawing
    the component. This function erases the old text (which wasn't drawn), thus
    drawing the text in the screen permanently.
    This fix disables all drawing functions when calling autoplacing function,
    and renables them afterwards.

    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto

    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    The filled circles (at the junction of nets) and filled boxes (at the
    end of unconnected nets) were the same color and it was hard to tell the
    difference from a distance.  This patch addes (junction-color ...) rc
    keyword and allows the user to change the junction color.  The default
    color for the dark color scheme is yellow and the default color for the
    light color scheme is purple.

    The "In Use" view shows symbols which are instantiated in open
    schematics, for ease of adding more symbols similar to the ones
    already present.  This is particularly useful for frequently-used
    symbols such as resistors and capacitors.

    gschem: Don't use generic response IDs for compselect actions.
    
    The component selector "OK" and "Apply" buttons aren't actually "OK"
    and "Apply" actions, so they shouldn't use those response IDs -- it's
    confusing.
    
    This patch adds special response IDs for these actions. This is a
    preparation for using "proper" Place and Hide icons & text.

    gschem: Fix a race condition with mouse wheel scroll events (1740327)
    
    If more than one mouse wheel scroll events are received into the event
    queue before the first one can be processed, then the program was
    zooming in to the wrong location.  This is because the mouse moved
    event handler, which is triggered by a call to warp the cursor in the
    scroll event handler, must run to update the mouse postion global
    variables that the scroll event handler needs.

    Add a function f_open_flags() which takes an extra argument which is a
    set of flags controlling actions taking while opening a file. f_open()
    wraps this with a default set of flags.
    
    Coincidentally, this also leads to a trivial fix for the file open
    dialog backup-message bug.

    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    pointers to CLibSymbols.  This is bad, because it makes removing
    component sources or rescanning them likely to cause stale pointers
    around the place.
    
    With fast hashtable-cached searches in place, this is no longer
    necessary.  This patch ensures that only symbol names are stored
    persistently.
    
    This patch also enables descending into embedded symbols using a
    component library lookup on the embedded symbol's name.

    Add s_clib_get_symbol_by_name().
    
    Add a new function which returns the first exact match for a given
    symbol name, printing log messages if either there are more than one
    match or no matches are found at all.  Also update
    s_clib_symbol_get_data_by_name() to use new function and remove
    o_complex_add_by_name() as more or less redundant.

    Make comp. library search faster and more flexible
    
    Replace s_clib_glob() with s_clib_search(), which can operate in
    either exact matching or glob matching mode.  Use a hashtable to cache
    the results of library searches. The hashtable is cleared every time
    it is invalidated (for instance if a component source is added or
    removed, or the component sources are rescanned).

    Refactor system RC files
    
    Moved system-gafrc into the libgeda package, where it belongs.
    Removed all environment and configure substitutions.  Created separate
    font and component library setup scripts in the symbols package,
    automatically loaded by system-gafrc if they exist.  Updated
    system-gschemrc to use new infrastructure.

    Removed code handling escape key presses in dialogs.
    
    Since GTK takes care of escape key presses, this code
    is not needed. Applied patch from Ivan Stankovic.

    Fix gschem's sort-component-library option
    
    In the last release, the sort-component-library gschemrc option did
    nothing.  This patch corrects the issue, by adding an argument to
    s_clib_get_sources which enables or disables sorting the list of
    component sources.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.

    Added call to g_thread_init() in Gschem and Gattrib.
    
    Gschem and Gattrib aren't threaded, but some of GTK's file chooser
    backends uses threading so we need to call g_thread_init().

    new GschemDialog class (A GtkDialog subclass).

    Implement new component library system in gschem.
    
    A new component library model was introduced into libgeda to
    allow gschem etc. to work well with database systems.  This
    patch updates gschem to use the new library system.  Most code
    dealing with creating, updating and (un)embedding symbols is
    affected.  However, this patch should not introduce any
    changes for the end-user.
