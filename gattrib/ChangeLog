        *  Ported code to GTK+-2.X.  Re-wrote Makefile.am & configure.ac.  Split
	   gtksheet.c into two versions, one for GTK-1.2 and one for GTK-2.X.
	   (Both copied from gtkextra.sf.net.)
	
	*  Many fixes related to moving to GTK-2.X

	*  Incorporated Ales' fix for "for" loop which had i=i++ construct.

	*  Eliminated spurious GTK warnings by testing for NULL in arguments 
	   before calling functions in gtksheet.c.

	*  Removed several extraneous files originally bundled with GtkSheet.

	*  Modified gattrib to work with soon-to-be-released libgeda 20040710.

	*  Implemented alphabetic sort of master_comp_list.
	
	*  Placed references to g_rc_reset_component_library and other
	   Guile fcns into g_register to enable Sri's RC customized files.

        *  Fixed bug in which a loop was terminating early, causing
	   large portions of some designs to be not processed.

	*  Added code to catch a cond where a design with no components
	   (i.e. no refdeses) or no modifiable attributes (i.e. no attribs
	   other than refdes) would cause a segfault.  Now program just
	   exits with an error message.

	*  Fixed bug in which graphical objects were not discarded
	   during the "add master list" loop.  This generated a 
	   spurious warning message.

	*  Fixed configure.ac to fix the GTK-1.2 vs. GTK-2.X problem
	   originally identified by Dan, and seen again by Sribalan 
	   Santhanam in rel 20040304.  Hopefully I fixed the bug this 
	   time!

	*  Fixed some compilation issues related to GTK-1.2 vs. GTK-2.X.
	   Dan McMahill discovered the problem, and also provided the
	   patches fixing it.  Thanks, Dan!

	*  "make install" now correctly installs system-gattribrc into
	   the place where the gEDA RC files live.  I had forgotten to
	   include this into the last release, and you had to do it by
	   hand.

	*  Initial release.

2003-12-05  Stuart Brorson  <sdb@cloud9.net>

	* Started hacking.
