Date:   Sat Jan 5 20:27:21 2008 -0500

    Added the use of GEDADATA environment variable to make gattrib relocatable
    
    gattrib was hardcoding the path to gattrib-menus.xml (using GEDADATADIR
    which is set at configure time).  This patch makes it possible to move
    the gattrib binary to a different prefix.  If GEDADATA is not set, then
    the original behavior of using GEDADATADIR to find gattrib-menus.xml is
    used.

    gattrib: Set default window icon to "gattrib" from the icon theme.
    
    When a "gattrib" icon is found in the icon theme, this will be used as the
    default application icon. For GTK versions < 2.6, some default sizes have
    been picked at which to look for icons. GTK >= 2.6 will find the best icon
    by name.

    XML files. Run gettextize after intltoolize if required, so that the
    infrastructure for providing libintl on a non GNU system still works.

    This reinstates error messages removed by the patch which modified
    f_open() to use GError for error reporting.

    concise, and will be addressed in later patches.

    Remove the ATTRIB linked list in favour of a GList
    
    The ATTRIB.copied_to pointer is moved from the ATTRIB struct to reside in
    the source OBJECT being copied.
    
    The ATTRIB *attached_to pointer of an attribute's text OBJECT is changed
    to OBJECT *attached_to, pointing directly at the OBJECT to which that
    attribute is attached. This avoids the need to traverse the ATTRIB list
    and retrieve this pointer from the HEAD attribute node. (A HEAD node is
    not used in the GList of ATTRIBs).
    
    The ATTRIB structure now only contains one element, OBJECT *object. This
    points to the text OBJECT holding and displaying that attribute's
    "name=value".

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Fixed a whole bunch of gtk+ 2.4.x and misc issues building on an older box
    
    This is a fix for (Patch#) 1789290 libgeda-1.2.0 fprintf which supplied a
    similar patch which fixes the issues in libgeda/src/s_clib.c and
    libgeda/src/s_textbuffer.c.  In the future, all releases will be built with
    gtk+ 2.4.x so that these sorts of problems do not get released.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    Moved 3 rc promotion keywords from gschem into libgeda (fix for bug#1748143)
    
    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    move menu callbacks to x_window.c
    
    This patch moves all menu callbacks to x_window.c, where
    they belong. The x_window_init() function is cleaned up.
    Selecting File->Open now causes the "unimplemented feature"
    dialog to pop up.

    gattrib: reorganize file opening code
    
    This patch reorganizes the file opening code
    and related code paths in gattrib. Besides
    simplifying the code, the patch also improves

    Changed configure.ac(.in) to allow guile-1.6
    
    Introduces compatibility #defines where guile 1.8 funcs are missing in
    guile 1.6. Also adds missing configure.ac checks for guile in packages
    gattrib, gnetlist, gsymcheck and utils.

    Change selection code to use a generic GedaList typecast to SELECTION.
    
    GedaList allows various parts of the program to keep track of changes
    to the selection via callbacks attached to the GedaList object.

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated copyright text/header in most source files.
    
    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.

    Added call to g_thread_init() in Gschem and Gattrib.
    
    Gschem and Gattrib aren't threaded, but some of GTK's file chooser
    backends uses threading so we need to call g_thread_init().
