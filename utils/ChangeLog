    Make sure various files are installed.
    
    Several new files were not being distributed. This patch addresses the
    problem by adding files to EXTRA_DIST in automake input files.

    Had to tweak gschem/po/de_DE.po since it was changed on the stable-1.0
    branch after this commit.  Removed libgeda/lib/Makefile.am and
    libgeda/scheme/Makefile.am which are not exist on this branch.  Had to
    manually add ChangeLog-1.0 to symbols/Makefile.am (this last fix should
    also probably go onto master).

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.
    
    Changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING to 1.0- since this is the stable-1.0 branch.
    Had to resolve a cherry-pick conflict in gattrib's about dialog box since
    it changed a bit more on the master branch.
